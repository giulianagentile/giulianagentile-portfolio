    <div id="myinfo"><p style="width:650px"> Poetry and photography are huge passions of mine which I continue to develop day by day. Moving to Argentina at 10 years old was a huge culture shock. I had only heard Spanish from my parents and could barely formulate a simple sentence. One day my English teacher talked to us about metaphors, hyperboles and oxymorons. Up to this point, I had seen language as my main barrier, without thinking of the parameters I could cross with its help. I could take advantage of the abstraction of language to construct my own images. I could talk about mental health without actually saying those words, making my poetry mean one thing to me but a different thing to someone else. I showed my verses to others as a way of letting them in on the circus of my mind. The more I propagated my art, the more liberated I felt. With time, I nerved myself into writing in Spanish too as I got used to how different words rhymed and rearranged to form poems about love, death and the streets of Buenos Aires. Later on in my teen years, I sought out to do the same with photography by using it as a tool to depict my curiosity with color, shadow, light and shapes. Fastforward to today, I have designed this website as a form a catharsis. Keep in mind: each image is a part of me, but not all. </p></div>
