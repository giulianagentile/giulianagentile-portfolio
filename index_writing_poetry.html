            <strong>The Lioness</strong>

            When I opened my front door to let out a scream,
            A lioness was already there, roaring at me.
            Her growl overshadowed my release of steam 
            And my invisibility grew to the size of my lonely idiosyncrasy.
            
            Even my aggravating heartbeat grew silent.
            Even the chirpy birds became tongue-tied.
            As her claw scratches got more violent,
            Her unnerving hoarse thunder amplified.
            
            I only desired to break my laughing box.
            I only desired for her to hear my agony,
            But I failed to realize her equal intent to detox.
            Still, I wished she noted her antagony.
            
            She opened wide to what would seem
            Like a black hole to enforce her regime.
            She towered over my esteem
            Until freedom was not more than a pipe dream.
            
            Wait.
            I continue to overthink when I should inhale.
            I have not tuned in to the meaning of her wail.
            
            She is practically begging for my ears.
            For she is even at my doorstep.
            The poor kitty, in tears.

            <strong>Sorry</strong>

            I’m sorry for what you’ve been through,
            For when loneliness was all you knew,
            For all the heartbreaks you had to ensue,
            For all the black holes you had to fall into.

            I’m sorry for the way you were treated,
            For all those who fleeted
            When things got heated.

            I’m sorry I didn’t know what to do
            For my world was also dark blue.
            I didn’t know yours was too
            Or that it could be easier as two.

            I’m sorry I locked myself away.
            I did not mean to betray.
            I swear all I did was pray.

            I’m sorry for not living up to
            Your idyllic false construe.
            I’m sorry I didn’t give you a clue
            Of what you had gotten into.

            I’m sorry and I miss you.
            We should stick to 
            what is tried and true:
            Me & You.

            <strong>The Castle</strong>

            A mystical dweller summoned me.
            Never again could I be at ease.
            He told me I had to choose my destiny
            As it was time to start paying my fees.

            First I thought of love
            Which I thought was decontrolled.
            Then my mentor guided from above
            To love what the future can mold.

            Then I thought of castles and envy,
            That I thought could cover my frenzy.
            My shrinking heart fought in a battle
            Against my glowing castle.

            My castle kept growing and growing
            While the years kept slowly flowing.
            When it had covered the Earth’s surface,
            I realized it had failed my purpose.

            Then I allowed my heart to bloom.
            I had just deprived it from eternity!
            Joy could only come when faith boomed.
            Pride could only flourish if obsession was fury.

            <strong>Enmascarada</strong>

            Todo aparentaba bien 
            hasta que me saqué el maquillaje.
            Me dijeron que parecía un tatuaje.
            Luego que parecía que tuviera cien.

            Más me ves, Más los ves.
            A la tinta encrustada en mis células
            Y a mis lágrimas al sentirla en mi piel.

            Pero sin estas cicatrices,
            Mi piel sería ajena
            Y llena estaría de deslices
            Llena, llena.
